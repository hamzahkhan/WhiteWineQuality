# WhiteWineQuality 
A classification model on the famous Wine dataset by UCI. Used KNN and Neural Networks to solve it. 
Tried my hand on the dataset, 3 files of interest above - 
1. ExploratoryDataAnalysis.ipynb -  Exploratory Data Analysis 
2. Neural_Network_model.ipynb  -  Deep Learning model using NN architecture in Keras and TF. 
3. Nearest_Neighbour.ipynb  -  Near Neighbour Analysis

Results at par (slightly better than most public blogs) present in results.txt file.
